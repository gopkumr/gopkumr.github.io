      <description>Recently I had a requirement to make a copy of a Function App from the production version to support a POC implementation of an solution upgrade.
One option was to deploy the Release branch which had the version same as in PROD (we already made updates to that function app post release, so DEV was already a lot of commits ahead). The challenge with this approach was, since we did not had a hotfix release, there were no Pipelines setup for Release branch.</description>
