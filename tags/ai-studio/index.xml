This addition grounds data and controls the context for the LLM’s response generation.
From Ungrounded to Grounded Prompts A pre-trained language model uses its training data to answer prompts. However, this data might not align with the prompt’s context. Grounding a prompt with relevant data transforms how a language model responds, making them more contextualized and accurate.</description></item></channel></rss>
