With VS2019 you won't.</title><link>https://www.beneathabstraction.com/post/namespaceupdate/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 18:50:46 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://www.beneathabstraction.com/post/namespaceupdate/</guid><description>Most of us programmers would have moved code files around to different folders at a different stages of the application development, this might be due to refactoring or redesigning or re-organizing. While moving around the code files, most .Net developers would have spent enough time changing the namespaces to match the folder structure (as better practice).
With Visual Studio 2019, this mundane task of changing the namespaces while moving folder is now automated, which means, visual studio updates the namespace to match the folder structure by itself.</description></item><item><title>Clean your code using Code cleanup in Visual Studio 2019</title><link>https://www.beneathabstraction.com/post/vs2019codecleanup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2016 14:22:48 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://www.beneathabstraction.com/post/vs2019codecleanup/</guid><description>All we developers would have spent time in cleaning up the code after we are done with a long day of code and coffee! for .Net developers it is to do with removing all the using clause added automatically by visual studio/nuget that you no longer need, removing variables that was not put to use, adding read only to eligible private variables, adding or removing braces from single statement blocks etc etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
