APIM policies are statements executed by Azure APIM to modify the behavior of API request, response and exception flows. The logic/conditions written as part of the policies are executed at various stages of API execution like, request received (inbound), before request sent to backend service/API (backend), before sending response to requester (outbound) and in case of any exceptions during the request processing (on-error). Policies are defined as an XML format with different tag to define the execution stage and the actual policy.</description></item></channel></rss>
