&lt;p&gt;While most of the application integration patterns are moving towards real-time, near-real-time and stream based solutions, there are still requirement to have batch file based data movement. These requirements are often for reporting or data warehousing scenario or while integrating with a legacy system.
While there are many products that help setup SFTP server, Azure was missing a SaaS offering for hosted SFTP server, like Amazon&amp;rsquo;s AWS Transfer on top of S3.
To host SFTP in Azure the customer has to setup their own SFTP workload either using a VM hosting an SFTP server and mounting the blob storage as a VM disk or hosting the SFTP server as a container on services like ACI and mounting the storage account.
While hosting an SFTP VM is not a complex task, but it adds to the organization&amp;rsquo;s maintenance list, to keep it up and running, securing it and patching updates while maintaining uptime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
