      <title>Cloning a Azure Function App</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had a requirement to make a copy of a Function App from the production version to support a POC implementation of an solution upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option was to deploy the Release branch which had the version same as in PROD (we already made updates to that function app post release, so DEV was already a lot of commits ahead). The challenge with this approach was, since we did not had a hotfix release, there were no Pipelines setup for Release branch. So we had to setup a pipeline, give the pipeline service account access to the POC resource group, then actually triggering the deployment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
