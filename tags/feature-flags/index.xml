Just to reiterate, feature management can be implemented using config files but this article is trying to implement feature flags connecting to Azure App configuration service.
Introduction The previous article described about implementing a boolean feature flag to turn on/off a feature. In this article I am trying to implement a custom feature flag.</description></item><item><title>Implementing Feature flags using azure</title><link>https://www.beneathabstraction.com/post/azurefeatureflags/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 10:00:48 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://www.beneathabstraction.com/post/azurefeatureflags/</guid><description>Feature flag is a very popular practice in modern application development, which is used to specifically hide features implemented that are not yet ready to be used by wider audience, and when ready can be enabled by a flip of a switch. The flags can also be used as a kill switch for application feature when it not working as expected.
With feature flags implemented, it would be effective to have the features enabled or disabled from a location outside of the application infrastructure or configuration, this way we can have features spanning across applications be controlled via a centralized flag.</description></item></channel></rss>
