The flags can also be used as a kill switch for application feature when it not working as expected.
With feature flags implemented, it would be effective to have the features enabled or disabled from a location outside of the application infrastructure or configuration, this way we can have features spanning across applications be controlled via a centralized flag.</description></item></channel></rss>
